 * Title: Java Programming: Level II 
 *
 * Description:
 * Create a class named CarRental that contains fields that hold a renterâ€™s 
 * name, zip code, size of the car rented, daily rental fee, length of rental
 * in days, and total rental fee. The class contains a constructor that requires
 * all the rental data except the daily rate and total fee, which are calculated,
 * based on the size of the car: economy at $29.99 per day, midsize at
 * $38.99 per day, or full size at $43.50 per day. The class also includes
 * a display() method that displays all the rental data.
 * 
 * Create a subclass named LuxuryCarRental. This class sets the rental 
 * fee at $79.99 per day and prompts the user to respond to the option of including
 * a chauffeur at $200 more per day. Override the parent class display() method 
 * to include chauffeur fee information.
 * 
 * Write an application named UseCarRental that prompts the user for the data 
 * needed for a rental and creates an object of the correct type. Display the 
 * total rental fee.
